# [2020 Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2) Notes

* Reading comprehension fail... I misread Part 2 the first time around, which slowed me down a bit.
* Still pretty straightforward, my initial solution worked as expected for both parts again. For part 2, I just reimplemented `valid_password?/1`.
