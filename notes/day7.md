# [2020 Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7) Notes

* Not sure why this one took me so long, it was a pretty simple graph problem. Well, part of it was that I didn't realize for a while that part 2 added a second sample dataset, but that only accounts for a few extra minutes. Then there was about 20 minutes of being pretty darn close, but not having the right order of operations somewhere.
