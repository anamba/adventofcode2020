# [2020 Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5) Notes

* I spent a lot of time, way too much time, reading over the description to find a catch, something that made it not just binary. But it was just binary. :facepalm:
* Yes, there was a more efficient way to do part 1 (without "calculating" all the seat numbers). But I had to write the `seat_id` function anyway, so why not just use it...
